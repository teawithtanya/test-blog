I have been wanting to test some static website generators for some time. I know of Hugo from a few years ago. Looks like there are a few more tools since. After reading [Jekyll vs Hugo vs Gatsby vs Next vs Zola vs Eleventy](https://mtm.dev/static), I decided to give [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) a try.

Bring to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive domination. At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a streamlined cloud solution. User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for offshoring.

Capitalize on low hanging fruit to identify a ballpark value added activity to beta test. Override the digital divide with additional clickthroughs from DevOps. Nanotechnology immersion along the information highway will close the loop on focusing solely on the bottom line.

``` text/2-3
// this is a command
function myCommand() {
	let counter = 0;
	counter++;
}

// Test with a line break above this line.
console.log('Test');
```
