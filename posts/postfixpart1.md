I wanted to setup an email forwarding / relay server on a custom domain and found these guides helpful.

## Linux VM

I started with Azure VM using Linux (ubuntu 20.04) and assigned a static public IP.

## DNS

+ Added A record for mail.example.com pointing to public IP
+ Added MX record for example.com pointing to mail.example.com
+ Added a PTR (reverse DNS) record mapping the public IP address to mail.example.com.

```powershell

$pip = Get-AzPublicIpAddress -Name "mail-ip" -ResourceGroupName "mail_group"
$pip.DnsSettings = New-Object -TypeName "Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Network.Models.PSPublicIpAddressDnsSettings"
$pip.DnsSettings.DomainNameLabel = "examplemail"
$pip.DnsSettings.ReverseFqdn = "mail.example.com."
Set-AzPublicIpAddress -PublicIpAddress $pip
```

+ Added a TXT record, with key example.com and value v=spf1 mx ~all
